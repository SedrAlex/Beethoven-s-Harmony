The system constructs a graph of classical musicians and their collaborations, using Node2Vec to create vector representations of each artist. These vectors help identify and recommend artists whose performance styles align closely with a user's favorite musicians.

Technologies Used:

    Graph Embeddings: Node2Vec is used to generate vector representations of musicians based on their collaboration patterns.
    Graph Construction: A graph is built using data from Spotify's API, representing collaborations between artists.
    Machine Learning: The system uses the similarity of vector representations to recommend artists.

This project is accessible via a user-friendly web application, allowing users to input their favorite artists and receive personalized suggestions instantly. "Beethoven's Harmony" not only broadens the listener's musical horizons but also fosters a deeper connection with the classical music community.
